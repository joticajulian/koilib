## Usage

### Browser

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My App</title>
    <script src="koinos.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      (async () => {
        const provider = new Provider(["http://api.koinos.io"]);
        const signer = Signer.fromWif("Kzl...");
        signer.provider = provider;
        const koinContract = new Contract({
          id: "15DJN4a8SgrbGhhGksSBASiSYjGnMU8dGL",
          abi: utils.tokenAbi,
          provider,
          signer,
        });
        const koin = koinContract.functions;

        // Get balance
        const { result } = await koin.balanceOf({
          owner: signer.getAddress(),
        });
        console.log(balance.result);
      })();
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Node JS

With Typescript import the library

```typescript
import {
  Signer,
  Contract,
  Provider,
  Transaction,
  Serializer,
  utils,
} from "koilib";
```

With Javascript import the library with require

```javascript
const {
  Signer,
  Contract,
  Provider,
  Transaction,
  Serializer,
  utils,
} = require("koilib");
```

There are 5 principal classes:

- **Signer**: Class containing the private key. It is used to sign.
- **Provider**: Class to connect with the RPC node.
- **Contract**: Class defining the contract to interact with.
- **Transaction**: Class to create transactions.
- **Serializer**: Class with the protocol buffers definitions to
  serialize/deserialize data types.

### Examples

#### Send tokens, get balance

The following code shows how to sign a transaction, broadcast
a transaction, and read contracts.

```typescript
(async () => {
  // define signer, provider, and contract
  const provider = new Provider(["http://api.koinos.io"]);
  const signer = Signer.fromWif("KwkAq...");
  signer.provider = provider;
  const koinContract = new Contract({
    id: "15DJN4a8SgrbGhhGksSBASiSYjGnMU8dGL",
    abi: utils.tokenAbi,
    provider,
    signer,
  });
  const koin = koinContract.functions;

  // Transfer
  const { transaction, receipt } = await koin.transfer({
    from: signer.getAddress(),
    to: "172AB1FgCsYrRAW5cwQ8KjadgxofvgPFd6",
    value: "1012345678", // 10.12345678 koin
  });
  console.log(`Transaction id ${transaction.id} submitted. Receipt:`);
  console.log(receipt);

  // wait to be mined
  const { blockNumber } = await transaction.wait();
  console.log(`Transaction mined. Block number: ${blockNumber}`);

  // read the balance
  const { result } = await koin.balanceOf({
    owner: signer.getAddress(),
  });
  console.log(result);
})();
```

#### Upload contract

It's also possible to upload contracts using koilib. You need the wasm file for that. There are several tools that can help you to develop smart contracts on Koinos:

- [Arkinos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arkinos): Complete tool to develop contracts in Assembly Script and bootstrap a website to interact with them.
- [koinos/sdk-as-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/@koinos/sdk-as-cli): SDK to develop contracts in Assembly Script.
- [koinos-sdk-cpp](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-sdk-cpp): SDK to develop contracts in C++.
- [koinosbox/contracts](https://github.com/joticajulian/koinos-contracts-as/tree/main/contracts): Contract examples created in Assembly Script. You can also import them in your project by using the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@koinosbox/contracts).

Here is an example on how deploy a contract:

```typescript
(async () => {
  // define signer, provider and bytecode
  const provider = new Provider(["http://api.koinos.io"]);
  const signer = Signer.fromWif("KwkAq...");
  signer.provider = provider;
  const bytecode = fs.readFileSync("my_contract.wasm");

  // create contract and deploy
  const contract = new Contract({ signer, provider, bytecode });
  const { transaction, receipt } = await contract.deploy();
  console.log("Transaction submitted. Receipt:");
  console.log(receipt);
  // wait to be mined
  const { blockNumber } = await transaction.wait();
  console.log(`Contract uploaded in block number ${blockNumber}`);
})();
```

You can also upload a contract in a new address. It is not required that this new address has funds, you just have to set your principal wallet as payer.

```typescript
(async () => {
  // define signer, provider and bytecode
  const provider = new Provider(["http://api.koinos.io"]);
  const accountWithFunds = Signer.fromWif("K... this account has funds");
  const newAccount = Signer.fromWif("L... new account without funds");
  accountWithFunds.provider = provider;
  newAccount.provider = provider;

  const bytecode = fs.readFileSync("my_contract.wasm");

  // create contract. Set newAccount as signer
  const contract = new Contract({
    signer: newAccount,
    provider,
    bytecode,
    options: {
      // transaction options
      // set payer
      payer: accountWithFunds.address,

      // use "beforeSend" function to sign
      // the transaction with the payer
      beforeSend: async (tx) => {
        accountWithFunds.signTransaction(tx);
      },
    },
  });

  // call deploy()
  // By default it is signed by "newAccount". But, as
  // in beforeSend it is signed by the payer then it
  // will have 2 signatures
  const { receipt } = await contract.deploy();
  console.log("Transaction submitted. Receipt: ");
  console.log(receipt);
  const { blockNumber } = await transaction.wait();
  console.log(`Contract uploaded in block number ${blockNumber}`);
})();
```

In fact, there are several ways to set a different payer and use it to upload a contract. This is another example:

```typescript
(async () => {
  // define signer, provider and bytecode
  const provider = new Provider(["http://api.koinos.io"]);
  const accountWithFunds = Signer.fromWif("K... this account has funds");
  const newAccount = Signer.fromWif("L... new account without funds");
  accountWithFunds.provider = provider;
  newAccount.provider = provider;

  const bytecode = fs.readFileSync("my_contract.wasm");

  // create contract. Set newAccount as signer
  const contract = new Contract({
    signer: newAccount,
    provider,
    bytecode,
  });

  // call deploy but do not broadcast the transaction.
  // Also set the payer
  const { transaction } = await contract.deploy({
    payer: accountWithFunds.address,
    sendTransaction: false,
  });

  // sign the transaction with the payer
  await accountWithFunds.signTransaction(transaction);

  // at this point the transaction will have 2 signatures:
  // - signature of newAccount
  // - signature of accountWithFunds

  // now broadcast the transaction to deploy
  const { receipt } = await newAccount.sendTransaction(transaction);
  console.log("Transaction submitted. Receipt: ");
  console.log(receipt);
  const { blockNumber } = await transaction.wait();
  console.log(`Contract uploaded in block number ${blockNumber}`);
})();
```

### Multisignatures

It can be configured to sign a single transaction with multiple accounts. Here is an example:

```ts
const signer2 = Signer.fromWif("KzP1...");
const signer3 = Signer.fromWif("L1t...");

const addMoreSignatures = async (tx) => {
  await signer2.signTransaction(tx);
  await signer3.signTransaction(tx);
};

const { transaction } = await koin.transfer(
  {
    from: "16MT1VQFgsVxEfJrSGinrA5buiqBsN5ViJ",
    to: "1Gvqdo9if6v6tFomEuTuMWP1D7H7U9yksb",
    value: "1000000",
  },
  {
    payer: signer2.getAddress(),
    beforeSend: addMoreSignatures,
  }
);
```

### Multiple operations in a single transaction

There are 3 ways to define a transaction with several operations. Use one of them as it is more convenient for you.

Using the Contract class. You can use `previousOperations` or `nextOperations` to attach more operations in the transaction:

```ts
const fn = contract.functions;
contract.options.onlyOperation = true;
const { operation: op1 } = await fn.set_owner({
  account: "16MT1VQFgsVxEfJrSGinrA5buiqBsN5ViJ",
});
const { operation: op3 } = await fn.set_address({
  account: "1Gvqdo9if6v6tFomEuTuMWP1D7H7U9yksb",
});
const { transaction, receipt } = await fn.set_name(
  {
    name: "test",
  },
  {
    previousOperations: [op1],
    nextOperations: [op3],
  }
);
await transaction.wait();
```

Using the Signer class with the Contract class. First all operations are created and then passed to the signer to create and send the transaction:

```ts
const fn = contract.functions;
contract.options.onlyOperation = true;
const { operation: op1 } = await fn.set_owner({
  account: "16MT1VQFgsVxEfJrSGinrA5buiqBsN5ViJ",
});
const { operation: op2 } = await fn.set_name({
  name: "test",
});
const { operation: op3 } = await fn.set_address({
  account: "1Gvqdo9if6v6tFomEuTuMWP1D7H7U9yksb",
});
const tx = await signer.prepareTransaction({
  operations: [op1, op2, op3],
});
const { transaction, receipt } = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
await transaction.wait();
```

Using the Transaction class:

```ts
const tx = new Transaction({ signer });
await tx.pushOperation(fn.set_owner, {
  account: "16MT1VQFgsVxEfJrSGinrA5buiqBsN5ViJ",
});
await tx.pushOperation(fn.set_name, {
  name: "test",
});
await tx.pushOperation(fn.set_address, {
  account: "1Gvqdo9if6v6tFomEuTuMWP1D7H7U9yksb",
});
const receipt = await tx.send();
await tx.wait();
```

### Estimate mana

Here is an example to estimate the mana. First create a transaction and sign it:

```ts
const tx = new Transaction({ signer, provider });
await tx.pushOperation(koin.transfer, {
  from: "1NRYHBYr9qxYQAeVqfdSvyjJemRQ4qD3Mt",
  to: "13UdKjYuzfBYbB6bGLQkUN9DJRFPCmG1mU",
  value: "1000",
});
await tx.sign();
```

Now send it with broadcast:false. With this option the rpc node will compute the
transaction but it will not broadcast it, then it will not be included in a block:

```ts
let receipt = await tx.send({ broadcast: false });
```

Finally, adjust the mana by taking a look to the rc used. In this example we will
adjust it by increasing it 10%. Then sign and send with the default option
(broadcast:true):

```ts
tx.adjustRcLimit(Math.round(1.1 * Number(receipt.rc_used)));
await tx.sign();
receipt = await tx.send();
```

### Create ABIs

ABIs are composed of 2 elements: methods and types.

- The methods define the names of the entries of the smart contract, the corresponding endpoints and the name of the types used.
- The types all the description to serialize and deserialize using proto buffers.

To generate the types is necessary to use the dependency protobufjs. The following example shows how to generate the protobuf descriptor from a .proto file.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const pbjs = require("protobufjs-cli/pbjs");

pbjs.main(["--target", "json", "./token.proto"], (err, output) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  fs.writeFileSync("./token-proto.json", output);
});
```

Then this descriptor can be loaded to define the ABI:

```js
const tokenJson = require("./token-proto.json");
const abiToken = {
  methods: {
    balanceOf: {
      entry_point: 0x5c721497,
      argument: "balance_of_arguments",
      return: "balance_of_result",
      read_only: true,
      default_output: { value: "0" },
    },
    transfer: {
      entry_point: 0x27f576ca,
      argument: "transfer_arguments",
      return: "transfer_result",
    },
    mint: {
      entry_point: 0xdc6f17bb,
      argument: "mint_argumnets",
      return: "mint_result",
    },
  },
  koilib_types: tokenJson,
};
```

## FAQ

1. Can this library be used to create smart contracts?

   No. There are another tools for that. Like [Arkinos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arkinos) or [koinos/sdk-as-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/@koinos/sdk-as-cli) for Assembly Script, or [koinos-sdk](https://github.com/koinos/koinos-sdk-cpp) for C++.

2. Can this library be used to deploy smart contracts?

   Yes. If you already have the contract compiled as a .wasm file you can use
   the Contract class to load the bytecode and deploy it.

3. Can this library be used to create the ABI for any smart contract?

   For the ABI you need the .proto file and the library
   [protobufjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs). Then follow the format
   for the ABI as described in the previous section. It's important to note that
   this ABI has some differences with respect to the ABI used in [koinos-cli](https://docs.koinos.io/architecture/contract-abi).
   In particular, koilib takes the descriptor from `koilib_types`, which is a
   descriptor in json format, while the ABI in koinos-cli takes the descriptor from
   `types`, which is a descriptor in binary format. There are also some differences
   in the format of "entry point" and "read only".

4. Can this library be used to interact with smart contracts?

   Yes. You can use it to call read_only functions, or send transactions
   to the contract by calling write functions.

5. How to generate random keys?

   To generate random mnemonic phrases and private keys use [@koinosbox/hdKoinos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@koinosbox/hdkoinos).
